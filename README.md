## Introduction
Early hospital mortality prediction is critical to make efÔ¨Åcient medical decisions about the severely ill patients staying in intensive care units (ICUs).
Most of mortality prediction methods need clinical records. However, some of the laboratory test results are time-consuming and and need to be processed.

In this project heart rate signals are used to predict mortality.
